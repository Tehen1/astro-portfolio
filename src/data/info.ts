  about:
  `I'm a budding developer based in Li√®ge, Belgium. Over the last ten years, I've honed my skills in the construction industry. 
  I'm also the proud parent of two children. 
  Former geek on too many online games. 
  During the COVID break, I took the opportunity to immerse myself in in-depth research and training in the fast-evolving field of blockchain(s). My passion is designing innovative creations, be they dynamic websites, cutting-edge applications or anything else that touches on the vast field of computer science. For over two years now, I've been expanding my knowledge, venturing into the fields of crypto-currencies, blockchain development teams and even trading. 
  Initially, focusing solely on coding was a challenge in the early stages. 
  However, I persevered. As a skilled front-end developer, I have substantial expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Solidity, Tailwind CSS, React JS and Kotlin. Although I've started many web projects from scratch, unfortunately I haven't completed the majority of them. 
  Nevertheless, my thirst for knowledge remains intact as I continually explore and adopt emerging technologies. 
  Currently, I'm actively seeking employment opportunities as a front-end or solidity & Kotlin developer. Rest assured that I am fully available to contribute my skills and expertise.",
