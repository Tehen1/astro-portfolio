  about:
  `I am a junior developer, based in Liege, Belgium. I worked for ten years in the construction industry. I have two children too, Ex gamers.
   I then took advantage of the covid break to spend a lot of time informing and training myself in a sector that is evolving at a crazy speed! 
   I love creating things, whether it's websites, applications or anything else that is close to a computer. 
   I've been training for more than 2 years, when I discovered crypto, dev teams on blockchain, 
   trading, It's hard to manage to focus only on the code....  The first years anyway!  
   Competent in front-end development. I have a "great" experience of a big year in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Solidity
   tailwind CSS, React JS, Next JS, and Kotlin. 
   I've done several web projects from scratch, but I haven't finished the majority of them. However, 
   I am always learning and never stop exploring new technologies

  I am currently looking for a job as a front-end developer or solidity & Kotlin. I am available immediately."
