  about:
  `I am an aspiring developer based in Liege, Belgium. For the past ten years I have been honing my skills in the construction industry. 
  In addition, I am the proud parent of two enthusiastic children. 
  Former geek on too many online games. 
  During the break from COVID, I took the opportunity to dive into extensive research and training in the rapidly evolving field of blockchain(s). My passion is designing innovative creations, whether they are dynamic websites, 
  cutting-edge applications or anything else that touches the vast field of computer science. For over two years, I have been dedicated to expanding my knowledge, venturing into the fields of crypto-currencies, blockchain development teams and even trading. 
  Initially, focusing solely on coding was a challenge in the early stages. 
  However, I persevered. As a skilled front-end developer, I have substantial expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Solidity, Tailwind CSS, React JS, and Kotlin. Although I've started many web projects from scratch, I unfortunately haven't completed the majority of them. 
  Nevertheless, my thirst for knowledge remains intact as I continually explore and adopt emerging technologies. 
  Currently, I am actively looking for job opportunities as a front-end or solidity & Kotlin developer. Rest assured that I am fully available to contribute my skills and expertise.",
