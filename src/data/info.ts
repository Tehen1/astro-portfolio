  about:
  `I am a budding developer based in Liege, Belgium. Over the course of ten years, I honed my skills in the construction sector. On top of that, I am a proud parent of two enthusiastic gamers. 
  
  Amidst the COVID hiatus, I seized the opportunity to immerse myself in extensive research and training in a rapidly evolving field.

  My passion lies in crafting innovative creations, whether it be dynamic websites, cutting-edge applications, or anything related to the vast realm of computing. 
  
  For more than two years, I have been dedicated to expanding my knowledge, venturing into the realms of cryptocurrencies, blockchain development teams, and even trading. Initially, 
  
  focusing solely on coding was a challenge during the early stages. However, I persevered.
  
  As a proficient front-end developer, I possess a substantial expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Solidity, Tailwind CSS, React JS, Next JS, and Kotlin. Although I have embarked on numerous web projects from scratch,
  
  I regrettably haven't completed the majority of them. Nonetheless, my thirst for knowledge remains unquenched as I continuously explore and embrace emerging technologies.
  
  At present, I am actively seeking employment opportunities as a front-end or solidity & Kotlin developer. Rest assured, I am readily available to contribute my skills and expertise."
