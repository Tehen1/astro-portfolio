  about: `I am a junior developer, based in Liege, Belgium. I worked for ten years in the construction industry. I have two children too, Ex gamers.
  I then took advantage of the covid break to spend a lot of time informing and training myself in a sector that is evolving at a crazy speed! 
  I love creating things, whether it's websites, applications or anything else that is close to a computer. I've been training for more than 2 years, when I discovered crypto, dev teams on blockchain, trading, It's hard to manage to focus only on the code.... 
  The first years anyway!  Competent in front-end development. I have a big experience of 1 year in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Solidity
  tailwind CSS, React JS, Next JS, and Kotlin. 
  I've done several web projects from scratch, but I haven't finished the majority of them. However, I am always learning and never stop exploring new technologies.
  I am currently looking for a job as a front-end developer or solidity & Kotlin. I am available immediately."
